                Utilizing open repositories of governmental data, we want our 
                partipating teams to analyze, synthesize, visualize or otherwise 
                showcase and experiment with data to the amusement of our judges.
                </p>
                <p>
                The teams with the best project will receive a prize.

                <p>
                We're looking for teams of 4 developers/designers.  If you've already got a team, sign up below and we'll see you on the 11th.  
                </p>
                <p>
                If not, register as an individual and we'll play matchmaker.  You'll hear from us before the event with some info about your teammates and we'll let you sync up and start brainstorming.  
                </p>
                <p>
                Either way, you'll be good to go with a team, hopefully an idea, and ready to get hacking on the 11th.
                </p>
